						<h1> About the NIE </h1>
					</header>

					<p>The Network of Industrial Economists is a forum for interchange among university economists
						in the UK and the world and for interaction between academia, business, and government on
						topics of industry economics.
					</p>

					<p> UK industrial economists established a study group in the 1970s, with mainly small,
						scattered, informal, London-centric meetings. In the 1990s,the study group enlarged and
						developed more regional involvement plus more participation from members researching
						different areas of industry economics: industries, firms, regulation, trade, technology, and
						national and regional growth. The by-then Network of Industrial Economists had become a
						forum not only for interchange about research, but also for two-way interaction between
						researchers and members from business, consultancy, and government agencies. The Network
						members are numerous and active; meetings often attract over 50 participants, half of all
						members choose to receive frequent communication via the Network's electronic discussion
						group, and total membership sums to roughly 400.
					</p>

					<p>
						Meetings have recently occurred around twice a year. A main annual meeting is open to all
						the Network's research sub-disciplines. Additional meetings focus on targeted issues, bringing
						together key researchers on important topics to share findings and methods and to communicate
						these issues to other researchers and policy makers. Meeting lengths have been two days for
						annual meetings and one to two days for topical meetings, in order to maximise participation
						and research benefits. Meetings have been in various locations throughout the UK.
